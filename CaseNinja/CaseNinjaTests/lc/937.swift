 You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.
 
 For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:
 
 Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
 Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
 We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.
 
 Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.
 
 Return the final order of the logs.
 
 Example 1:
 
 Input: ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
 Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]
 
 Note:
 
 0 <= logs.length <= 100
 3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
 logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.
